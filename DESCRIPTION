Description: Utilities that support 'R' data-science project workflows by
    standardizing console logging, reproducible diagnostics, and package
    development tasks. The toolkit captures color-coded logs with persistent
    files, includes helpers to recreate data objects for debugging, automates
    coverage reporting for interactive sessions, and provides RStudio addins
    for common IDE operations that can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts.
