Description: Utilities that support data-science project workflows by standardizing
    console logging, reproducible diagnostics, and package development tasks. The
    toolkit captures color-coded logs with persistent files, includes helpers to
    recreate data objects for debugging, and automates coverage reporting via
    covr-aware restart handling for interactive sessions.
